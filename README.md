## What is QuickXiv?

QuickXiv is a browser extension that detects when you're reading an arXiv paper and offers a one-click structured summary in a sidebar. It uses the Hugging Face Inference API to generate summaries organized into clear sections:

- **What It Solved** — the problem or gap the paper addresses
- **How It Solved It** — the proposed method or approach
- **Key Results** — concrete findings, metrics, and comparisons
- **Limitations & Future Work** — open questions and suggested extensions

## Features

- **One-click summaries** — detects arXiv papers automatically, summarizes on demand
- **Streaming output** — summary appears progressively as the model generates it
- **Section references** — inline `§ Section` tags indicate where each point comes from
- **Smart caching** — previously summarized papers load instantly (7-day TTL)
- **Usage tracking** — monitor your API token usage with the built-in dashboard
- **Universal Chromium support** — works in Chrome, Arc, Edge, Brave, and more
- **Clean sidebar UI** — modern card-based design that sits beside the paper

## Screenshots

## Installation

1. **Clone or download** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/armandblin/QuickXiv.git
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page:
   - Chrome: `chrome://extensions/`
   - Arc: `arc://extensions/`
   - Edge: `edge://extensions/`
   - Brave: `brave://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner)
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `QuickXiv` folder
5. Navigate to any arXiv paper — the sidebar will appear automatically

## Setup

On first use, QuickXiv will ask for your **Hugging Face API key**:

1. Go to [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Create a **fine-grained token** with the `Make calls to the serverless Inference API` scope
3. Paste the token (starts with `hf_`) into the extension

Your key is stored locally via `chrome.storage.sync` and never sent anywhere except the HF API.

## How It Works

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Model | `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` | HF model used for summarization |
| Max tokens | `1500` | Maximum output length |
| Cache TTL | 7 days | How long summaries are cached locally |
| Sidebar width | 420px | Width of the injected sidebar |

## Tech Stack

- **Manifest V3** Chrome Extension
- **Hugging Face Inference API** with SSE streaming
- **ar5iv** for HTML paper extraction (no PDF parsing needed)
- Vanilla JS — zero dependencies, no build step
